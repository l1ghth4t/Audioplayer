The audio player for Winsows OS. Created in .NET C#.

## About the program
The program can play audio files on your computer, such as music, audiobooks, and other audio files. The audio player was created for the Windows OS, based on the WMP player. The user interface was created using the Metro Framework. The TagLib library was also used to read audio file tags.

## Interface
The program has a simple user interface. On the left side of the program, there are three tiles that allow you to open and pause an audio recording. The "Open new" tile opens the open file dialog where the user can select an audio file on disk. The "Pause" tile interrupts the audio file playback. When the audio file is paused, the tile is named "Play". When you click again, the audio file continues to play. The "Stop" tile stops playing the audio file. In addition, there is a progress bar at the bottom of the program that allows you to rewind the audio file to any position.

## Install

Installer language is Russian. In the next version, the language selection will be added. The program is deleted in the same way as any application in Windows OS.
